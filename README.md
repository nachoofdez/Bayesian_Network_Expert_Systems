# Bayesian Network Expert Systems
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of Bayesian networks in expert systems. The project focuses on applying Bayesian network theory to represent and update knowledge in expert systems, with a specific emphasis on a medical example discussed in a reference paper.

## Key Features
- Importing and exploring the dataset.
- Mutual information analysis to identify variable dependencies.
- Building Bayesian networks using `pgmpy`.
- Comparing learned networks with the original network described in the reference paper.
- Evaluating models using various metrics such as BIC, K2, log-likelihood, and accuracy.
- Selecting the most suitable model based on validation cross-validation results.

## Implementation Details
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `pgmpy`, `cdt`, and other standard Python libraries.
- **Code:** The notebook provides detailed explanations and comments for each step of the analysis.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to gain insights into Bayesian networks and their applications in expert systems, particularly in medical domains. By implementing and analyzing Bayesian networks, we aim to understand probabilistic reasoning and knowledge representation in expert systems.
